---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. ✅ Clean text while preserving BERT-relevant features
2. ✅ Extract 14 smartphone aspects from reviews
3. ✅ Create stratified train/val/test splits (70/15/15)
4. ✅ Handle class imbalance through stratification
5. ✅ Save processed datasets for model training

---

## 📂 **Input/Output**

### **Input:**
- `Dataset/reviews_clean_2015_2019.csv` (from EDA Phase 2.5)
- `config/aspects.json` (aspect keywords)

### **Output:**
- `Dataset/processed/train.csv` (~43,000 samples)
- `Dataset/processed/val.csv` (~9,200 samples)
- `Dataset/processed/test.csv` (~9,200 samples)
- `outputs/figures/aspect_distribution.png`
- `outputs/figures/split_distribution.png`

---

## 🚀 **Execution Steps**

### **Step 1: Setup** (5 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Load required libraries
- Import preprocessing module
- Verify environment

**Files involved:**
- `src/data/preprocessor.py` (already created)
- `notebooks/02_preprocessing.ipynb` (execution notebook)

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Libraries loaded successfully!
📦 Pandas version: 2.x.x
📦 Numpy version: 1.x.x
```

---

### **Step 2: Load Clean Dataset** (2 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Load filtered dataset (2015-2019, no empty reviews)
- Verify 61,553 reviews loaded
- Check sentiment distribution

**Code:**
```python
df = pd.read_csv('../Dataset/reviews_clean_2015_2019.csv')
```

**Expected output:**
```
📊 DATASET LOADED
📝 Total Reviews: 61,553
😊 Sentiment Distribution:
   Positive: 42,128 (68.44%)
   Negative: 15,099 (24.52%)
   Neutral:   4,326 ( 7.03%)
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Confirm 61,553 reviews loaded

---

### **Step 3: Text Preprocessing** (10-15 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Lowercase conversion
- URL removal (`http://`, `www.`)
- HTML tag removal (`<br>`, `<p>`)
- Contraction expansion (`don't` → `do not`)
- Whitespace normalization
- **Preserves punctuation** (BERT needs it!)

**Configuration:**
```python
preprocessor = TextPreprocessor(
    lowercase=True,              # ✅ BERT works better lowercase
    remove_urls=True,            # ✅ Remove links
    remove_html=True,            # ✅ Remove HTML
    expand_contractions=True,    # ✅ don't → do not
    remove_special_chars=False,  # ❌ KEEP for BERT!
    min_length=3                 # ✅ Filter <3 words
)
```

**Code:**
```python
df_processed = preprocessor.preprocess_dataframe(df, text_column='body')
```

**Expected output:**
```
🔧 Preprocessing 61,553 reviews...
   Cleaning column: 'body'
   ⚠️  Filtered 142 reviews with <3 words
   ✅ Preprocessing complete: 61,411 reviews
```

**Before/After Example:**
```
BEFORE: "Don't buy this! Battery life is TERRIBLE!! Visit www.example.com"
AFTER:  "do not buy this! battery life is terrible!!"
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** ~61,400 reviews after filtering

---

### **Step 4: Aspect Extraction** (15-20 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Load 14 aspect categories from `config/aspects.json`
- Match keywords to review text
- Create binary columns (`has_battery`, `has_camera`, etc.)
- Calculate aspect frequency statistics

**Aspects extracted:**
1. Battery
2. Camera
3. Screen
4. Performance
5. Design
6. Price
7. Signal
8. Audio
9. Size
10. Software
11. Durability
12. Features
13. Buttons
14. Service

**Code:**
```python
aspect_extractor = AspectExtractor(
    aspects_config_path='../config/aspects.json'
)
df_processed = aspect_extractor.add_aspect_columns(
    df_processed, 
    text_column='cleaned_text'
)
```

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Extracting aspects from 61,411 reviews...
   ✅ Aspect extraction complete!
   📊 Average aspects per review: 2.34

   Top 5 Most Mentioned Aspects:
      price          : 25,432 reviews (41.41%)
      performance    : 18,765 reviews (30.56%)
      battery        : 16,892 reviews (27.51%)
      camera         : 14,231 reviews (23.17%)
      screen         : 12,089 reviews (19.68%)
```

**Sample output:**
```
Review: "great phone but battery life is terrible. camera quality is good."
Extracted Aspects: [battery, camera]
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Aspect columns added, avg ~2-3 aspects per review

---

### **Step 5: Stratified Splitting** (5 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Split dataset into train/val/test (70/15/15)
- **Stratify by sentiment** (preserves class distribution)
- Verify distributions match across all splits

**Code:**
```python
train_df, val_df, test_df = create_stratified_splits(
    df_processed,
    target_column='sentiment',
    train_size=0.70,
    val_size=0.15,
    test_size=0.15,
    random_state=42
)
```

**Expected output:**
```
📂 Creating stratified splits...
   Target column: 'sentiment'
   Split ratios: 70% / 15% / 15%

   ✅ Splits created:
      Training:   42,988 samples (70.0%)
      Validation:  9,212 samples (15.0%)
      Test:        9,211 samples (15.0%)

   📊 Class Distribution Verification:
      Split        Positive     Negative     Neutral
      --------------------------------------------------
      Original     68.44%       24.52%       7.03%
      Train        68.44%       24.52%       7.04%
      Val          68.43%       24.53%       7.04%
      Test         68.45%       24.51%       7.04%

   ✅ Stratification verified - distributions match!
```

**Why stratified?**
- Handles class imbalance (68% Positive, 7% Neutral)
- Each split has same class ratio
- Model sees balanced representation during training/validation

**✅ Checkpoint:** All splits maintain ~68/25/7 distribution

---

### **Step 6: Save Processed Data** (2 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Save train/val/test to CSV files
- Store in `Dataset/processed/` directory
- Preserve all columns (cleaned text, aspects, labels)

**Code:**
```python
save_processed_data(
    train_df, val_df, test_df,
    output_dir='../Dataset/processed'
)
```

**Expected output:**
```
💾 Saving processed datasets...
   ✅ Saved: Dataset/processed/train.csv (42,988 rows)
   ✅ Saved: Dataset/processed/val.csv (9,212 rows)
   ✅ Saved: Dataset/processed/test.csv (9,211 rows)

      - aspects
      - aspect_count
      - has_battery
      - has_camera
      ... (14 aspect columns)
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** 3 CSV files created in `Dataset/processed/`

---

### **Step 7: Quality Verification** (3 minutes)

**What happens:**
- Check for missing values

## 🎯 **Key Design Decisions**

### **1. Why preserve punctuation?**
- ✅ BERT was trained with punctuation
- ✅ "Great!" vs "Great?" have different sentiments
- ✅ Helps BERT understand emphasis

### **2. Why lowercase?**
- ✅ BERT-uncased model expects lowercase
- ✅ Reduces vocabulary size
- ✅ "Battery" = "battery" = same token

### **3. Why expand contractions?**
- ✅ "don't" → "do not" is clearer for BERT
- ✅ Separates negation ("not") for better sentiment detection
- ✅ Standard NLP practice

### **4. Why stratified split?**
- ✅ Handles 68/25/7 class imbalance
- ✅ Each split represents full population
- ✅ Prevents biased validation results

### **5. Why 70/15/15 ratio?**
- ✅ 70% train = enough data for BERT fine-tuning (43K samples)
- ✅ 15% val = sufficient for hyperparameter tuning (9K samples)
- ✅ 15% test = reliable final evaluation (9K samples)
- ✅ Industry standard for deep learning

## ⚠️ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Module not found**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```
**Solution:**
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('..')  # Add parent directory to path
```

### **Issue 2: File not found**
```
FileNotFoundError: reviews_clean_2015_2019.csv
```
**Solution:** Run EDA notebook first to generate clean dataset

### **Issue 3: Unequal split sizes**
```
Train: 70.2%, Val: 14.9%, Test: 14.9%
```
**Solution:** This is normal - splits won't be exactly 70/15/15 due to rounding

### **Issue 4: Low aspect count**
```
Average aspects per review: 0.5
```
**Solution:** Check `config/aspects.json` exists and has keywords
