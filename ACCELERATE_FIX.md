# ✅ Accelerate Library Installed

## What Just Happened

The `accelerate` library was missing, which is required by Hugging Face's `Trainer` class for distributed training and optimization.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Installed:** `accelerate>=0.26.0`

**The kernel was automatically restarted** to load the new library.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **You Need to Re-run Previous Cells:**

Since the kernel restarted, you need to run cells again from the beginning:

1. **Cell 2:** Set cache directory (D: drive)
   ```
   ✅ Cache directories set to D: drive
   ```

2. **Cell 5:** Imports
   ```
   ✅ Imports successful!
   CUDA available: True
   ```

3. **Cell 7:** Configuration
   ```
   ✅ Configuration set
   ```

4. **Cell 9:** Load data
   ```
   ✅ 61,000 reviews loaded
   ```

5. **Cell 11:** Load RoBERTa model
   ```
   ✅ RoBERTa-base loaded (downloading to D: drive)
   ```

6. **Continue from Cell 13 onwards...**

7. **Cell 20:** Training arguments (this should work now!)
   ```
   ✅ Training arguments configured!
   ```

## 📋 What Accelerate Does

The `accelerate` library provides:
- 🚀 Distributed training support
- 🎯 Mixed precision training (FP16)
- 💾 Memory optimization
- 🔧 Multi-GPU support
- ⚡ Performance improvements

**Required for:** Hugging Face `Trainer` class

---

## ⚠️ Important

**Kernel Restarted = Variables Lost**

You need to re-run cells from the top to restore:
- Cache directory settings
- Imports
- Configuration
- Data loading
- Model loading

**Then proceed to training!**

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist

After kernel restart:
- [ ] Run Cell 2 (cache setup)
- [ ] Run Cell 5 (imports)
- [ ] Run Cell 7 (config)
- [ ] Run Cell 9 (load data)
- [ ] Run Cell 11 (load model - will download ~500MB to D: drive)
- [ ] Run Cell 13 (create dataset)
- [ ] Run Cell 15 (split dataset)
- [ ] Run Cell 17 (data collator)
- [ ] Run Cell 20 (training args) - should work now! ✅
- [ ] Continue to training...

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Problem:** Missing `accelerate` library  
**Solution:** Installed via `pip install accelerate>=0.26.0`  
**Side Effect:** Kernel restarted (expected)  
**Next Step:** Re-run cells from top to restore state  
**Then:** Cell 20 (training args) will work!  

---

**Ready to continue?** Start from Cell 2 and run through the cells! 🚀

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Accelerate installed, ready to configure training!
