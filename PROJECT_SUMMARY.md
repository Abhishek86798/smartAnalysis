# 📋 PROJECT SUMMARY - SmartReview ABSA System

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Project:** Intelligent Product Review Analytics using Enhanced BERT  
**Your Name:** [Your Name]  
**Advisor:** [Advisor Name]

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING**

An **AI-powered system** that analyzes smartphone reviews and tells you:
- Overall sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Sentiment per aspect (battery good but camera bad)
- Which features customers love/hate
- Visual insights and recommendations

**Example:**
```
Input: "The battery life is amazing! I can go 2 days without charging. 
        However, the camera quality is disappointing in low light."

Output:
{
  "overall_sentiment": "positive",
  "aspects": {
    "battery": {"sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.95},
    "camera": {"sentiment": "negative", "confidence": 0.89}
  }
}
```

## 📊 **YOUR DATASET**

- **Source:** Amazon Cell Phone Reviews (Kaggle)
- **Size:** 67,987 reviews
- **Products:** 721 different phones
- **Features:** Review text, ratings (1-5 stars), dates, verified purchases
- **Perfect for:** Training BERT models for sentiment analysis

---

## 🏗️ **YOUR APPROACH (3-Stage Strategy)**

### **Stage 1: Baseline (Week 1-2)**
Use existing BERT model → Fine-tune on your data → Get working system

**Expected Results:**
- Sentiment Accuracy: 80-85%
- Aspect F1 Score: 0.70-0.75

### **Stage 2: Enhancement (Week 3)**
Train RoBERTa → Domain adaptation → Better performance

**Expected Results:**
- Sentiment Accuracy: 87-90%
- Aspect F1 Score: 0.78-0.82

### **Stage 3: Deployment (Week 4)**
Build web app → Create visualizations → Present findings

---

## 🎓 **WHY THIS APPROACH IS SMART**

1. **Uses State-of-the-Art:** BERT/RoBERTa (used by Google, Facebook)
2. **Transfer Learning:** Don't train from scratch, adapt existing models
3. **Domain Specific:** Fine-tune on phone reviews for better accuracy
4. **Practical Application:** Real-world use case (e-commerce analytics)
5. **Impressive Results:** Comparable to research papers
