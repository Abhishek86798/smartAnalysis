# 🎯 Phase 7: Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis (Future Work)

## 📅 Planned Start: After RoBERTa Enhancement Complete

---

## 🔮 What is Aspect-Level Sentiment?

### Current System (Review-Level):
```
Review: "Battery is great but camera is disappointing"
Output: Neutral (overall sentiment)
```

**Problem:** Loses granular information about individual aspects!

### Future System (Aspect-Level):
```
Review: "Battery is great but camera is disappointing"
Output: 
  - Battery: POSITIVE 😊
  - Camera: NEGATIVE 😞
  Overall: NEUTRAL 😐
```

**Benefit:** Detailed insights for each aspect separately!

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Business Value:
1. **Product Teams:** "Which aspects need improvement?"
2. **Marketing:** "What features do customers love?"
3. **Customer Service:** "What are common complaints?"
4. **Competitive Analysis:** "How do we compare on battery life?"

### Technical Goals:
1. Predict sentiment for each of 14 aspects independently
2. Handle multi-aspect reviews (most reviews mention 2-3 aspects)
3. Achieve 75%+ accuracy per aspect
4. Create explainable predictions

---

## 📊 Our 14 Aspects

```
1. Battery Life      8. Design
2. Camera Quality    9. Software/UI
3. Screen/Display    10. Connectivity
4. Performance       11. Audio Quality
5. Build Quality     12. Display Quality
6. Price/Value       13. Features
7. Storage           14. Overall Value
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation Approaches

### Option A: Multi-Output Classification (RECOMMENDED)

**Architecture:**
```
RoBERTa Encoder (shared)
    ↓
    ├── Aspect 1 Classifier (3 classes: Pos/Neu/Neg)
    ├── Aspect 2 Classifier (3 classes: Pos/Neu/Neg)
    ├── Aspect 3 Classifier (3 classes: Pos/Neu/Neg)
    └── ... (14 total classifiers)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Shared knowledge across aspects
- ✅ Efficient training
- ✅ Can leverage current data

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Need aspect-specific labels (partial labels OK!)
- ❌ Class imbalance per aspect

---

### Option B: Aspect Extraction + Sentiment

**Two-Stage Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: Aspect Extraction**
```
Input:  "Battery is great but camera is disappointing"
Output: ["Battery", "Camera"]
```

**Stage 2: Aspect Sentiment**
```
Aspect: "Battery" + Context → POSITIVE
Aspect: "Camera" + Context → NEGATIVE
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ More interpretable
- ✅ Can add new aspects easily
- ✅ Works with current aspect extraction (already implemented!)

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Two separate models to maintain
- ❌ Errors compound across stages

---

### Option C: Sequence Tagging (Advanced)

**BIO Tagging:**
```
Input:  "Battery is great but camera is disappointing"
Tags:   B-BAT   O  B-POS O   B-CAM  O  B-NEG

B-BAT = Begin Battery aspect
B-POS = Begin Positive opinion
B-CAM = Begin Camera aspect
B-NEG = Begin Negative opinion
O     = Outside (neutral word)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ State-of-the-art approach
- ✅ Joint learning of aspects + sentiment
- ✅ Handles complex cases

**Challenges:**
- ❌ Requires BIO-tagged training data
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Harder to debug

---

## 📋 Data Requirements

### Current Data:
```
✅ Review text
✅ Overall sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
✅ Aspect extraction (14 aspects per review)
```

### Needed for Aspect-Level Sentiment:
```
❌ Aspect-specific sentiment labels
   Example:
   {
     "review": "Battery great, camera bad",
     "aspects": {
       "battery": "positive",
       "camera": "negative"
     }
   }
```

---

## 🔨 Implementation Plan (When You're Ready)

### Phase 1: Data Annotation (1-2 weeks)

**Option 1: Manual Annotation**
- Sample 1000-2000 reviews
- Annotate aspects + sentiments manually
- Use annotation tool (e.g., Label Studio)

**Option 2: Weak Supervision**
- Use current aspect extraction
- Infer sentiment from overall review sentiment
- Use keyword patterns for refinement
- Example rules:
  ```
  "battery is great" → Battery: POSITIVE
  "camera is bad" → Camera: NEGATIVE
  "screen is okay" → Screen: NEUTRAL
  ```

**Option 3: LLM-based Annotation**
- Use GPT-4/Claude to annotate samples
- Verify quality on sample
- Use as training data

---

### Phase 2: Model Development (1-2 weeks)

**Week 1: Multi-Output Architecture**
```python
class AspectSentimentModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_aspects=14, num_classes=3):
        self.roberta = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-base')
        
        # 14 separate classifiers
        self.aspect_classifiers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(768, num_classes)
            for _ in range(num_aspects)
        ])
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.roberta(input_ids, attention_mask)
        pooled = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0]  # [CLS] token
        
        # Predict sentiment for each aspect
        aspect_logits = [
            classifier(pooled) 
            for classifier in self.aspect_classifiers
        ]
        
        return aspect_logits
```

**Week 2: Training & Evaluation**
- Train with aspect-specific loss (handle missing labels)
- Evaluate per-aspect F1 scores
- Error analysis and refinement

---

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (1 week)

**Full Pipeline:**
```
1. Input review text
2. Extract aspects (existing AspectExtractor)
3. Predict sentiment per aspect (new model)
4. Aggregate results
5. Visualize on dashboard
```

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- A/B testing with review-level baseline

## 🔧 Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Missing Aspect Labels
**Problem:** Not all reviews mention all aspects
**Solution:** 
- Use "Not Mentioned" class (4 classes total)
- Or only predict sentiment for mentioned aspects
- Mask loss for missing aspects

### Challenge 2: Class Imbalance per Aspect
**Problem:** Some aspects rarely negative (e.g., Screen usually positive)
**Solution:**
- Per-aspect class weights
- Focal loss for hard examples
- Data augmentation

### Challenge 3: Multi-Aspect Interactions
**Problem:** "Great battery but heavy" - weight affects battery usability
**Solution:**
- Graph neural networks for aspect relationships
- Cross-aspect attention mechanisms
- Hierarchical modeling
