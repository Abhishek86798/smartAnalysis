## üìö Existing ABSA Models & Research

### 1. Pretrained ABSA Models on Hugging Face

#### **srimeenakshiks/BERT-ABSA**
- **Base Architecture:** BERT-base-uncased
- **Training:** Fine-tuned for aspect-based sentiment analysis
- **Use Case:** General ABSA tasks
- **Advantages:**
  - Ready-to-use for ABSA
  - Saves training time
  - Good baseline model
- **Limitations:**

## üî¨ Key Techniques to Implement

### 1. **Continued Pretraining (Domain Adaptation)**
```python
# Masked Language Modeling on phone reviews
Input:  "The [MASK] quality is exceptional"
Output: "The camera quality is exceptional"
```

**Why?**
- Adapts model to phone-specific vocabulary
- Learns domain patterns (e.g., "battery drain", "screen protector")
- Improves downstream task performance

**When to use:** If we have GPU resources and want maximum performance

---

### 2. **Two-Stage Fine-Tuning**
```
Stage 1: Overall sentiment classification (1-5 stars)
Stage 2: Aspect-based sentiment (per aspect)
```

**Advantage:** Easier convergence, better results

---

### 3. **Multi-Task Learning (Advanced)**
```
Task 1: Aspect extraction (NER-style)
Task 2: Aspect sentiment classification
Task 3: Overall sentiment

Shared BERT encoder ‚Üí Multiple task heads
```

**Advantage:** Better representations, more efficient
